 From today onward i'm a system engenier working as a Devops
</h2>


<h1> Hello, This is a simple devops webpage!!   </h1>
<h2> Data Service Group is your learning partner </h2>
<h2> Glad to see you here </h2>
<h1> Good job Serge on learning Devops</h1>
<h1> I'm glad as i'm writting this project. I'm fully conficed in my heart that before the end of this year i'm leading my devops job</h1>
 <h1>Watch the video in week21 and set up your DevOps CI/CD pipeline.


<h1>1- Everyone is saying DevOps and talking about DevOps , what do you think is DevOps?</h1>


	 It is a culture in the IT world which integrates the Development and Operation team with the goal of developing and deploying good quality applications in a fast manner and safe company time and DevOps helps you to get feedback faster. 


2- What tools do you use in your devops pipeline?


	Github

	Git

	Jenkins

	Maven

	Docker

	Ansible

	kubernetes


3- Why should companies consider DevOps?


	Below are some of the advantages of devops and these advantages provide a clear understanding as to why companies should consider implementing devops.


	Predictability: DevOps offers significantly lower failure rate of new releases


Reproducibility: Version everything so that earlier versions can be restored anytime.


Maintainability: Effortless process of recovery in the event of a new release crashing or disabling the current system.


Time to market: DevOps reduces the time to market up to 50% through

streamlined software delivery. This is particularly the case for digital and mobile applications.


Greater Quality: DevOps helps the team to provide improved quality of application development as it incorporates infrastructure issues.


 Reduced Risk: DevOps incorporates security aspects in the software

delivery lifecycle. It helps in reduction of defects across the lifecycle.


 Resiliency: The Operational state of the software system is more stable, secure, and changes are auditable.


Cost Efficiency: DevOps offers cost efficiency in the software

development process which is always an aspiration of IT companies'

management.


Breaks large code base into small pieces: DevOps is based on the

agile programming method. Therefore, it allows breaking larger code

bases into smaller and manageable chunks.



4- What is your favorite tool? and why?


	 I like working with Jenkins because the console output gives me clue as to what is going on as compared to other tools where a job fails and you do not know why it failed


5- What is CI/CD?


	CI (Continuous Integration): It is the process by which Developers are continuously making changes in the code, committing those codes, those codes are being built, packaged and stored in an artifactory.

	

CD (Continuous deployment): It is the process of continuous deployment of the artifacts that we have in our artifactory, testing them, and delivery to production; and continuous delivery (continuous deploying artifacts)


6- What is microservice?


	Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are highly maintainable and testable, loosely coupled, independently deployable, organized around business capabilities, owned by a small team


7- What is the agile methodology?


	Agile is a process by which a team can manage a project by breaking it up into several stages and involving constant collaboration with stakeholders and continuous improvement and iteration at every stage. The Agile methodology begins with clients describing how the end product will be used and what problem it will solve.


8- How do you troubleshoot a failed deployment in kubernetes?


	I will use the #kubectl get deploy to check the deployment. When i  run #kubectl get deploy, it will show the status of the deployment (failed or successful).  



9- What is the difference between Devops and Agile methodology?


	Agile is a software development methodology that focuses on iterative, incremental, small, and rapid releases of software, along with customer feedback. It addresses gaps and conflicts between the customer and developers while DevOps is a culture that allows the development and the operations team to work together. This results in continuous development, testing, integration, deployment, and monitoring of the software throughout the lifecycle.


10- There is a code being developed by a developer and that code is to deploy a page with holiday wishes to users.



Your job is to set up the whole CI/CD pipeline for this new app.


- go ahead and create a repository in github called holiday


- add all files from your helloworld repository into this new repository.


- Create a branch called release_branch that will be used for testing and the master branch will be used for prod deployment.


- Set up a job in Jenkins with a pull scm trigger every minute.


- the app is a java app so will be deployed in a tomcat environment. set jenkins to create a war file with the code and deliver it to docker registry.</h1>
